Small Sagemath implementation to solve ODE of charged double pendulum in oscillating Electric field as a project submission for Analytical mechanics class.
Solved from combined Lagrangian of EM-field and double pendulum, ignoring EM-field from charge movement.

Animations are made for selected initial conditions. Results can be seen in .mp4 file or at: https://youtu.be/8cxtiK-lvE4?si=vMSGyeYL3JTjr-nX
